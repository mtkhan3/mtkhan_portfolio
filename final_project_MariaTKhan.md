The following is the beginning planning and brainstorming phase of my final project for the data visualization coruse I am in. 

**High Level Summary:** 
Stereotypes about immigrants have led to policies that separate families, large financial investments on border control, and fuel hate crimes. Data dispels myths about immigrants, fosters tolerance, and encourages righteous policies in the United States and for the communities we all belong to.   

**Outline, including Story Elements and Data Sources:**
I. Xenophobia is a global phenomenon, including in our home; the United States.

II. Myth 1: Increase in Immigrants Increases Crimes + Violence
  
  >Data Visualization 1: 
  >Truth: “Each one of those murders is a tragedy but the chance that an American would be successfully killed by a refugee terrorist was one in 3.6 billion a year. Each year an American had a 0.000000028 percent chance of being murdered by a refugee terrorist each year (for those with poor eyesight, that’s seven zeros to the right of the decimal point). That's a small risk.”

  >Truth: “Immigrant populations in the United States have been growing fast for decades now. Crime in the same period, however, has moved in the opposite direction, with the national rate of violent crime today well below what it was in 1980.”

  >Truth: “According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while the overall percentage of immigrants and the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. both increased sharply between 1990 and 2010, the violent crime rate in the U.S. during that time plummeted 45 percent and the property crime rate dropped by 42 percent.”

III. Myth 2: Immigrants take jobs from native born Americans.
  Data Visualization 2: 
  Truth: “This paper demonstrates that low-skilled Mexican-born immigrants’ location choices respond strongly to changes in local labor demand, which helps equalize spatial differences in employment outcomes for low-skilled native workers… Further, Mexican mobility reduced the incidence of local demand shocks on natives, such that those living in metro areas with a substantial Mexican-born population experienced a roughly 50 percent weaker relationship between local shocks and local employment probabilities.”

  Truth: “Immigrants make up 17 percent of the U.S. labor force, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Census data shows that immigrants accounted for 24 percent of nursing, psychiatric and home care aides in 2015. A study from the bipartisan research organization New American Economy found immigrants were 15 percent more likely to work unusual hours than similar U.S.-born workers. They are also more likely to be employed in dangerous jobs, according to data from the American Community Survey and Bureau of Statistics.”

V. Call to Action: 
  A) Share one thing you learned today with someone. 
  B) Engage in conversations around immigration reform WITH immigrant communities.
  C) Vote. 

VI. ??? Humanize the data and the numbers… How to incorporate a message that the data just shows numbers but there are real human beings and families and people we all know behind these numbers. ???


**Method and Medium:**
In order to execute a successful data visualization story, I plan to:
  1. Create an excel spreadsheet with all the final data I plan to use for this project. 
  2. Develop a skeleton website using Shorthand as my chosen platform for this project.
  3. Create visualizations largely utilizing Tableau and other online sources for data visualization such as rawgraphics.io. 
  4. Ask friends and colleagues for feedback on my visualizations. Ensure that the visualizations follow a color theme and style. 
  5. Upload the visualizations to the website. 
  6. Write in text to provide context and complete the story. 
  7. Collect images with proper citation that correlate to the story and upload to the website.  
  8. Ask friends and colleagues for feedback. 
  9. Make final edits and publish.
