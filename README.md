# About Me
Hello, my name is Maria T. Khan and I'm currently taking a course in data visualization at Carnegie Mellon University. Learn a little bit more about me in my short bio below. 

Maria T. Khan is a writer, daughter, immigrant, a proud Muslim-American and an occasional poet. She is pursuing a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management with a data analytics concentration at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Heinz College and holds a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies with honors from the University of California, Irvine. An alumna of the prestigious Coro Public Affairs Fellowship in Southern California, Maria has worked with cross-disciplinary sectors on research and development, corporate social responsibility, and community engagement, primarily in her hometown of Los Angeles. She seeks to become a storyteller who uses data to highlight gaps in migrant labor patterns, improve resettlement systems, and advocate for effective immigration policies.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how data visualization can serve as a medium to empower those that are not literate in udnerstanding data to understand the data and utilize it in their respective work. I believe that the data we collect is only as valuable as how we craft and tell a story about it. I don't want to be a great data analyst, I want to be a great data storyteller. I hope to learn how to capture the attention of stakeholders with data visualization and start conversations on improving systems based on data.
