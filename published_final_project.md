And just like that, the final data visualization story is complete. The entire process is a lot more tipsy turvy than what I was prepared for. Here’s a behind the scenes of my thought process when developing the final story. 

The intended audience for my final data story remains the same as I had initially planned. I wanted to be able to capture information relatable to a general audience, ideally for those on both sides of the political spectrum. I realized in my initial user interviews that I was primarily speaking with individuals who leaned on one side.

The intended audience for my final data story remains the same as I had initially planned. I wanted to be able to capture information relatable to a general audience, ideally for those on both sides of the political spectrum. I realized in my initial user interviews that I was primarily speaking with individuals who leaned on one side. To try and cater for all different types of viewpoints, I was careful to use apolitical language as much as possible. 

For example, there is heavy debate among calling immigrants who are not legally approved to reside in the United States as illegal immigrants or as undocumented immigrants. I chose to use the phrase unauthorized immigrants throughout my story as to avoid either one of these terms that can insinuate certain viewpoints. I also tried to avoid jargon and heavy statistical analysis that readers from various levels of education can understand. Lastly, I kept asking different individuals for feedback on my story as it continued to develop. 

In the process of creating this data visualization story, I was most surprised to learn 1) the value of a mood board 2) the effects of eye travel and lastly, 3) how much I enjoyed piecing the story together. When I first created a mood board, I was excited to play around with the colors, develop my own palette and consider what kind of themes I wanted to come across from my story. As I began to create my actual story, I found it frustrating to be able to find platforms where I could customize my data visualizations to the mood board I had already created. 

Nonetheless, I chose to use platforms like Tableau, Canva, and Google Forms to create my visuals because they allowed me to choose custom colors for my features and as it comes together, I think this mood board made a huge difference in setting a cohesive tone for my story. Secondly, I kept finding that as I was “hallway” testing my story to friends and colleagues, one of the most common themes in the feedback was related to eye travel. The more I could simplify the visuals and reduce eye travel, the more receptive I found my audience to be. Lastly, I was surprised by how much investment I found myself making into every minute detail of the project. While there were many parts of the creative process when I wanted to pull my hair out, I also found myself loving the art of storytelling from a lens that combines my passion for policy, data, and communication.
